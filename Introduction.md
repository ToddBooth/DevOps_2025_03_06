### Short Description of the above

Here is a short description of the above:

- **Azure Boards:**  
  A work tracking system that provides agile planning, backlog management, and visualization tools to help teams organize, track, and manage their work items.

- **Azure Repos:**  
  A set of version control tools offering unlimited, cloud-hosted private and public Git repositories, supporting collaborative code development and efficient source control management.

- **Azure Pipelines:**  
  A continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) service that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying applications across multiple platforms and environments.

- **Azure Artifacts:**  
  A package management service that enables teams to create, host, and share packages (e.g., NuGet, npm, Maven) within their development lifecycle, ensuring consistent dependency management.

- **Azure Test Plans:**  
  A comprehensive testing solution that supports both manual and exploratory testing, helping teams manage test cases, track defects, and ensure software quality before release.

- **What is infratructure as code (IaC)?**  
  Instead of manually creating and modifying cloud resources, we programatically create the resources.

- **How Microsoft Develops with DevOps**  
  This is a ver complex example as to how Microsoft implements DevOps for thie development.

- **Implement a code workflow in your build Azure DevOps pipeline by using Git and GitHub**  
  This is an advanced hands-on lab, which will take about two hours, to implement a DevOps CI/CD pipeline.
